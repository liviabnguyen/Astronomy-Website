        <h1> The Solar System </h1>
        <p> The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that is orbiting around it. This includes planets, moons, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and etc. Many believed that the solar system was formed by a rotating cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. The solar nebula collapsed due to its gravity; it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled towards the center to form the sun. Other particles within the disk collided and stuck to asteroid-sized objects, also known as plantestimals, combined to become asteroids, comets, moons, and planets. There are eight full-sized planets in the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto used to be considered the ninth and most distant planet from the sun, but it is now the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system. There are 193 moons in our solar system. There are over 150 million asteroids floating in the solar system, but this is the count for asteroids larger than 100 meters.</p>
